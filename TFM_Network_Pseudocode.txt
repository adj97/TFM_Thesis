TFM Network Pseudocode

Define - road network and each road's characteristics
       - each junction

Calculate - global network max speed
          - total network length
          - lists of source and sink roads

Define - spatial resolution dx
       - final time end T
       - CFL constraint

Calculate - time resolution dt from CFL

Create - spatial grid points
       - initial global density profile

Save - initial profile to final data array
